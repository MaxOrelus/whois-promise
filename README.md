## Installing

```sh
npm install --save whois-promise
```

## Demo

### Promise

```js
const whois = require('whois-promise');

// raw output
whois.raw('mozilla.org').then(response => console.log(response));

// json object output
whois.json('mozilla.org').then(response => console.log(response));
```

### Async/Await

```js
const whois = require('whois-promise');

// raw output
(async () => {
  console.log(await whois.raw('mozilla.org'));
})();
